# Forest Stand Height (FSH) Python Scripts
Produced by the University of Massachusetts Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory. 

113 Knowles Engineering Building, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA 01003.

Yang Lei, (ylei@caltech.edu, leiyangfrancis@gmail.com), Paul Siqueira (siqueira@ecs.umass.edu).

The Python 2 version of the scripts were updated to Python 3:
- Thannarot Kunlamai (SERVIR-Mekong, Asian Disaster Preparedness Center)
- Tim Mayer (timothy.j.mayer@nasa.gov, tjm0042@uah.edu)
- Helen Baldwin (helen.b.baldwin@nasa.gov, hbb0009@uah.edu)
- Simon Kraatz (skraatz@umass.edu)

***Besides contacting the authors via email for technical questions, it is also recommended to [refer to the closed issues or open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/leiyangleon/FSH/issues).***

## Table of Contents:

### I. Required software packages and installation (https://github.com/sgk0/FSH/blob/master/installation.md)

### II. How to run FSH (https://github.com/sgk0/FSH/blob/master/how_to_run.md). 

- Please note that users will have to be able to generate their own interferograms. FSH was tested using PALSAR interferograms generated by ROIPAC and ISCE (up to v 2.2 use the insarApp.py workflow; 2.3+, use the stripmapApp.py workflow) software. Hence we provide three test_example folders ('test_example_ISCE_insarApp', 'test_example_ISCE_stripmapApp', 'test_example_ROIPAC'). Each folder contains a text file starting with 'NOTES_' describing how to obtain the example interferograms to be used to test this software installation. ***We recommend that the ISCE stripmapApp.py workflow is used, as the other options have been deprecated and are not actively supported***.

- Information and tutorials regarding ISCE and interferogram processing can be found at http://earthdef.caltech.edu/projects/isce_forum/boards. To those interested in pursuing their own interferogram processing, we used modified ISCE scripts which are provided with the FSH software, and described here: https://github.com/sgk0/FSH/blob/master/isce_preprocessing.md

### III. List of python files and corresponding descriptions (https://github.com/sgk0/FSH/blob/master/reference.md)

Forest Stand Height (FSH) Python Scripts. This software performs the automated forest height inversion and mosaicking from spaceborne repeat-pass L-band HV-pol InSAR correlation magnitude data (e.g. JAXA’s ALOS-1/2, and the future NASA-ISRO’s NISAR) that have been pre-processed by JPL’s ROI_PAC and/or ISCE programs.
