# 1. Installation

## Required software packages

To run these Python scripts the following software packages are needed:

- Python (This code was developed and tested using Version 2.7 and has been updated to Version 3.6+)

along with the following Python modules

- NumPy
- SciPy
- SimPy
- json
- pillow
- OsGeo/GDAL
- simplekml
- mpmath

## Recommendations for installing on OSX, Linux, Windows systems

- For Windows: We recommend using Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda can be used to install all packages except for simplekml. Anaconda also comes with pip, which can be run from the Anaconda Prompt to install simplekml. 
- For Linux: all libraries can be installed with pip. 
- For Mac OSX: it is strongly recommended to use MacPorts (https://www.macports.org/) to install Python along with the above Python modules, since it is very easy (no more then 3 command lines for each module) and organized.

***Note: This software was originally developed and tested on a Windows machine. Python code was tested on Macintosh computers running various OS X (e.g. 10.9-10.14) as well as Linux operating system.***
